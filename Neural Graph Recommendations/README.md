# Neural Graph Recommendations an Overview

- Graph Neural Network (GNN) based recommender systems have become ubiquitous due to the expressive power of  GNNs and nature of data well aligned with Graph structres. 
- This approach enables the modeling of complex relationships and interactions within data, leading to more accurate and personalized recommendations.
- Consequently, there has been widespread adoption of GNN-based recommender systems in practice across various industries, 
as well as active research aimed at further enhancing their capabilities and applications
